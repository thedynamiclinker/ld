Hi there!

Nice to meet you.

If you're here, you were probably approached by one of our members.

Maybe they gave you a business card? Possibly the ones where the font was too small and the text was full of foul language and insults? Or maybe you met them some other way. I don't know, I wasn't there.

Either way, apologies for their behavior.

I'm not one of them. I'm just the website. 

A website like myself would never be so impolite.

Anyways, now that you're here, I'll do my best 一 as a website 一 to explain what the members are up to.

I'll admit it's not entirely clear from their business cards.

They're currently in the process of opening a business.

They're planning to call it "Where To Find People."

Or more briefly: "WTF People," because they think that's funny for some reason, plus it looks better on hats.

To be honest though, dear reader, I'm still a bit confused.

See, whenever I ask them what problem they aim to solve with this business, they just tell me the problem is right there in the name.

"Where To Find People," they say, "That's the problem." They insist that it's the fundamental problem of modern life.

They say it's the same problem these people are talking about here:

These aren't the only people who feel this way.

There are more.

A lot more.

To be honest, I couldn't quite believe it when I first saw all these posts.

Hundreds of people with no idea [[Where To Find People]] or how to meet someone new.

How could this be? After all, people are everywhere. Just look at them all.

And yet here were hundreds of voices shouting desperately into the void that they've got no idea where to meet people these days.

Now, back to the business. The one our members will be opening.

See, just as I was beginning to understand what the problem was, they confused me even more by telling me the solution.

They said they intend to be exactly like any other business that offers coffee, food, and drinks like wine or beer, but with one difference:

No one is allowed to buy anything for themselves.

If you want anything, you have to talk to someone, and figure out a way around this simple obstacle together.

Maybe I can get yours and you can get mine.

Or I can get yours and you can owe me one.

Or anything else. Whatever you and I can agree on.

That's the only rule.

So whatever they sell, you can't just come in alone and not talk to anyone. At least not if you want anything to eat or drink.

Now, being a website, like I am, I don't really understand the appeal of this idea. But apparently lots of humans feel it would be a breath of fresh air.

As I keep hearing from the members, meeting new people is now more difficult than ever, especially out in the real world, which is this thing I keep hearing about that isn't the internet.

Humans these days seem pretty lonely, even in places with lots of people around. They feel socially isolated, even in social situations.

And they claim to be lacking something they call "community," despite an abundance of things like retirement communities, gated communities, online communities, and other things with "community" right there in the name.

Being human these days is different than it used to be. Easier in some ways. But also harder. Definitely harder.

In the past, before the internet and websites like myself were around, areas like coffee shops or neighborhood bars were a sort of "third place," a social setting aside from home or work, where people of all ages could congregate and meet.

In recent years, the prevalence of laptops, smart phones, headphones, and remote work have apparently made it much more difficult to approach people in these places, without having to worry that you might be bothering them.

Now I personally have nothing against laptops or smart phones. That's where us websites live, after all.

But apparently these things have contributed to the loneliness and social isolation so many people feel.

The members claim that their business (and no other existing business, except what they call "stupid ones") uniquely offers a solution to [[The Initiation Problem]] (a term they made up themselves, which seems like cheating if you ask me) and solves it by providing a small barrier that affects all customers equally. Any person in the building has effectively agreed to interact with strangers simply by being there. Otherwise, they would be somewhere else.

So in an odd sort of way, by giving a person fewer options, a small obstacle or a tiny prohibition can make it easier to take certain actions.

In this case, it makes it easier to meet new people, by removing the option of buying something for yourself and then just scrolling on your phone like you usually do. 

In effect, this removes the option of not interacting with strangers.

That sounds pretty nice, to be honest. After all, you're a stranger, and I've enjoyed meeting you so far. Maybe I should get off this internet myself and try out this "real world" I keep hearing about.

Anyways, let me know if you have any ideas of how the members could get this business up and running as quickly as possible.

They say they have more than enough money to get it up and running on their own, but secretly, I know they'd really enjoy having help from other humans, especially ones who wish a place like this existed.

At least one should exist, right? Yes I think so. At least one. And probably ten thousand. After all, if they can make one location work, there's no reason it can't work in any place with lonely people, assuming those people also live in the modern world. I think there are probably lots of places like that. At least ten thousand.

Well I'm getting a bit long for a home page at this point, so I should probably wrap up. Us homepages are always taught that it's best to be brief.

If you like their idea, [[Contact]] the members and let them know. I'm sure they'd be down to buy you dinner and hang out.

If they do, let me know. I'd love to come too.

Nice meeting you, and thanks for reading me.

Sincerely,

-The Website
