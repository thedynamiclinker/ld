Hi there!

Nice to meet you.

If you're here, you were probably approached by one of our members.

Maybe they gave you a [[Business Cards|business card]]? Possibly the ones where the font was too small and the text was full of foul language and insults? Or maybe you met them some other way. I don't know, I wasn't there.

Either way, apologies for their behavior. I'm not one of them. I'm just the website. A website like myself would never be so impolite.

Anyways, now that you're here, I'll do my best 一 as a website 一 to explain what the members are up to.

They're currently in the process of opening a business.

They're planning to call it "Where To Find People," or more briefly: "WTF People." 

To be honest though, dear reader, I'm still a bit confused.

See, whenever I ask what problem they aim to solve with this business, they just tell me the problem is right there in the name. "Where To Find People." They insist that it's the fundamental problem of modern life.

They tell me it's the same problem that these people are talking about here:

After scrolling through hundreds of similar posts asking [[Where To Find People]], I was left feeling quite disoriented.

After all, people are everywhere. Just look at them all.

And yet here were hundreds of voices shouting desperately into the void that they've got no idea where to find any.

Now, back to that business. The one our members will be opening.

See, just as I felt I was beginning to understand the problem, they went and confused me even more by telling me their solution.

They said they intend to be exactly like any other business that offers coffee, food, and light drinks like wine or beer, but with one difference:

No one is allowed to buy anything for themselves.

If you want anything, you have to talk to someone, and figure out a way around this simple obstacle together.

For example, I can get yours and you can get mine. Or I can get yours and you can owe me one. Or anything else. Whatever you and I can agree on.

That's the only rule.

So whatever they sell, whether it's a cappucino, a bagel with cream cheese, a cold beer, a glass of wine, or a big silly hat, you can't just come in alone and not talk to anyone. At least not if you want anything to eat or drink.

Now, being a website, like I am, I don't really understand the appeal of this idea. But apparently lots of humans feel it would be a breath of fresh air.

As I keep hearing from the members, meeting new people is now more difficult than ever, especially out in the real world, which is this thing I keep hearing about that isn't the internet.

Humans these days appear to be lonely, even in rooms with lots of people around.

Socially isolated, even in social situations.

And they claim to be lacking something they call "community," despite an abundance of such things as retirement communities, gated communities, and other words with "community" right there in the name.

Still, being a human these days is different than it used to be. Easier in some ways. But also harder. Definitely harder.

In the past, areas like coffee shops or neighborhood bars were a sort of "third place," a social setting aside from home or work, where people of all ages could congregate and meet.

In recent years, the prevalence of laptops, smart phones, headphones, and remote work have apparently made it much more difficult to approach people in these establishments, without having to worry that you might be bothering someone.

Now I personally have nothing against laptops or smart phones (that's where us websites live, after all). But apparently it's made being human a lot more complicated, lonely, and socially isolating.

The members claim that their business uniquely solves [[The Initiation Problem]], by providing a small barrier that affects all customers equally. Any person in the establishment has effectively agreed to meeting strangers simply by being there. Otherwise, they would be somewhere else.

That sounds pretty nice, to be honest. After all, you're a stranger, and I've enjoyed meeting you so far. Maybe I should get off this internet myself and try out this "real world" I keep hearing about. It sounds nice.

Anyways, let me know if you have any ideas of how the members could get this business up and running as quickly as possible. They say they have more than enough money to get it up and running on their own, but secretly, I know they'd really enjoy having help from other humans, especially ones who agree that something like this absolutely needs to exist.

Well I'm getting a bit long for a home page at this point, so I should probably wrap up. Us homepages are always taught that it's best to be brief.

If you like their idea, shoot them an email, and remind them who you are and where you met them or how you got here. I hear they're giving those rude [[Business Cards]] out to lots of people in different parts the city, in order to see where they should open the first location.

So go make [[Contact]] with the members, and if they hear from enough people in your area, maybe they'll open the first location near you.

When they do, let me know. I'd love to come too.

Nice meeting you, and thanks for reading me.

Sincerely,

-The Website

P.S. There are some other webpages floating around in that sidebar over to the left. They're works in progress. No promises about what's in there, or whether it makes sense yet. Some of the members are open source software nerds, so they seem to think it's ok to just publish stuff that isn't done yet.

Sincerely (again),

-TWS
