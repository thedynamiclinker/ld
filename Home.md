Oh hi there!

If you're here, you were probably approached by one of our members.

Maybe they gave you a [[Business Cards|business card]] where the font was too small and the text was full of foul language and insults? Or maybe you met them some other way, I don't know, I wasn't there.

Either way, apologies for their behavior. I'm not one of them. I'm just the website. A website would never be so impolite.

Anyways, now that you're here, I'll do my best 一 as a website 一 to explain what the members are up to.

They're currently looking to open a business. As far as I can tell, they intend to be exactly like any other business that offers coffee, food, and light drinks like wine or beer, but with one difference: No one is allowed to buy anything for themselves. If you want anything, you have to talk to someone, and figure out a way around this rule.

For example, I can get yours and you can get mine. Or I can get yours and you can owe me one, or anything else. But whatever they sell, whether coffee, food, wine, a hat, or anything else, you can't just come in alone and not talk to anyone.

Being a website, like I am, I don't really understand the appeal of the idea. But apparently lots of humans feel it would be a breath of fresh air. See, being a human these days is different than it used to be.

From what the members have told me, meeting new people is now more difficult than ever, especially out in public. In the past, areas like coffee shops or neighborhood bars were a sort of "third place," a social setting aside from home or work, where people of all ages could congregate and meet.

In recent years, the prevalence of laptops, smart phones, headphones, and remote work have apparently made it much more difficult to approach people in these establishments, without having to worry that you might be bothering someone.

Nothing against laptops or smart phones (that's where us websites live, after all). But apparently it's made being human a lot more complicated, lonely, and socially isolating. At least that's what I hear from the humans.

They say that their business will be unique, in that you can be assured that anyone else in the building is open to meeting strangers. Otherwise, they wouldn't be there. That sounds pretty nice, to be honest. After all, you're a stranger, and I've enjoyed meeting you. Maybe I should get off this internet myself and try out this "real world" I keep hearing about. It sounds nice.

Let me know if you have any ideas for how the members could get this business up and running. They say they have more than enough money to get it up and running on their own, but secretly, I know they'd really enjoy having help from other humans who agree that something like this needs to exist.

Anyways, I'm getting a bit long for a home page at this point, so I should probably wrap up. 

If you like the idea, shoot them an email, and remind them who you are and where you met. I hear they're giving those rude [[Business Cards]] out to lots of people in different parts the city, in order to see where they should open the first location.

So go make [[Contact]] with the members, and maybe they'll open the first location near you.

When they do, let me know. I'd love to come too.

Sincerely,

-The Website
