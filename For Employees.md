- Reid Hoffman predicts that the traditional [9-to-5 job will be extinct](https://www.businesstoday.in/latest/corporate/story/9-to-5-jobs-are-doomed-linkedin-co-founder-reid-hoffman-predicts-their-end-by-2034-438837-2024-07-26) by 2034.
- Such a dramatic prediction about the job market normally wouldn't be worth taking seriously.
- Coming from founder of LinkedIn, it may merit some thought. He knows the job market.
- There has never been a time in history when it suddenly became so easy to undercut so many large corporations.
- The best way to do so is with a diffuse network of entrepreneurially minded individuals, outside the bounds of a single corporate umbrella.

- We need people who love [Tech](https://technical.thedynamiclinker.com) but who feel out of place on most tech teams; nerds who love all the tribes of Linux and Unix; who would place more trust in a random person on the OpenBSD subreddit than a highly credentialed corporate security engineer; who love to code but think that 90% of code should be deleted; who think Defcon and Blackhat talks are a better source of scientific wisdom than the science departments in academia.
- We need people who fantasize about starting a [Business](https://technical.thedynamiclinker.com) but don't know how; who have more savings than they need, but no interests expensive enough to spend it all on; the fellow over-educated travellers who left academia; or the under-educated autodidacts with with impostor syndrome; the builders who have thus far spent their careers building someone else's dream.
- We need people who love [Humans](https://social.thedynamiclinker.com) but lack a tribe where they belong, who can get along with any individual but never quite feel at home in a group; who prefer a little trauma bonding to never bonding at all; who feel anxious when all is well, and calm and focused when the house is on fire; who prefer the excitement of a shared risk undertaken with close friends to a life where one is entirely safe and alone.

- If that sounds like you, we want you.
