## Business Description

**Concept & Theme**

- Each table plays the role of a Thread in online forums.

- Each table has a Host, taking the role of the Original Poster (OP) in online forums.

- Each table has a small TV on the wall next to it, on which that table's post will appear.

- At any given time, the host of each table is responsible for that table's "post."

- A table's post can be a question, a comment, a rant, a meme, or any other user-generated content, within reason.

- People can come in, see what threads (questions, thoughts, rants, etc.) are currently posted above each table, and talk to whichever OP (table host) they're currently interested in responding to.

- Optionally, for conversations lasting longer than a few moments, a person may sit down at a given thread and order food or drinks, and contribute to the discussion around the topic of that table.

- The cost of hosting a table will vary as a function of demand, from no cost in low-traffic hours, up to $50/hour depending on congestion and demand.

- We will offer monthly subscriptions for a certain number of post-hours per month. A monthly subscription offers a discount relative to standard pricing, possibly outside of peak hours depending on demand. This gives the business a potential for more stable monthly income for no additional input cost.

**Examples of the Concept**

We plan to allocate part of the menu to explain how the concept of an "Online Forum, but in person" works in practice.

To illustrate, imagine a first time customer enters the establishment. As she walks around, she sees people eating or drinking at tables showing the following posts, one post per table, on small (20"-30") TVs attached to the wall above each table.

The first table's TV might say:

- Starting a doggy day care business in my house nearby. Dog owners come talk to me!

A college student sits on her laptop with a coffee at the next table, under a post saying:

- Confused about physics homework. Help!

A young couple eating dinner sits under a post that says:

- We're looking to open a restaurant but we're knew to the industry. Anyone have any experience running a restaurant?

An older man sits with a beer under a post saying:

- Vietnam war veteran. Ask me anything.

The remaining tables say things like:

- New to town, looking for people to hang out with.

- This news about Elon and Doge is nuts. What do you guys think?

- Bored. This table is now a poker game. Loser buys the next round.

The content of the posts is up to the customers, and is limited only by their creativity and by a few common sense moderation rules.

Despite being a novel concept for a brick and mortar business, we believe most visitors will find the concept easy to understand, due to the widespread familiarity with online forums, and the superficial resemblance to a standard food and drink establishment.

The only difference from online forums is that here, posts and replies occur in person, allowing real social interactions and new human connections to be forged.


**Location Requirements**

- 1,400-2,000 sq. ft.

## Risk Analysis

**Potential Challenges & Mitigation Strategies**

- **Regulatory Hurdles:** San Diego county is known to be among the worst locations in the country in terms of building permits and approval times. We plan to engage professionals to help expedite this process, but we will require a sufficient number of months of free rent to allow permitting, construction, and interior decoration to proceed without taking on unnecessary risk arising from delays caused by city planning or related municipal government departments.
- **Technology Integration:** We will need to provide a seamless experience for managing table threads and digital displays. Given the owners' professional background in technology and software engineering, this poses minimal risk.
- **Target Market and Customer Acquisition:** We will need to approach marketing more seriously and aggressively in the initial months than a typical restaurant. Given the owners' professional backgrounds in social psychology and human cognition, we do not expect this to pose a significant risk.

**Summary**
- We see moderate risks arising from regulatory delays and permitting in San Diego county. We believe our background and financial situation are more than sufficient to mitigate any additional risks arising from the business model itself.

## Conclusion

The Internet is an innovative social space designed to address a growing cultural need: the difficulty of meeting new people in public places. By combining elements of online forums with a real-world social experience, The Internet offers a one-of-a-kind venue that fosters meaningful connections.
