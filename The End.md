## Goodbye World

Hi there,

This file is for employers, founders, CEOs, leaders, and anyone who cares about the ancient art of coordinating groups of humans toward a common goal.

---

In a business with a 20% margin, every $1 in cost-cutting is worth $5 in sales. And the largest cost in running a company is employees.

We specialize in automating jobs for a living, so we know what we can and can't do.

We have no ability to automate entrepreneurs or blue collar workers.

We can't replace your plumber or your electrician. Or the Cambodian lady who owns the sandwich shop down the street.

We can't replace your company's CEO or COO.

But a lot of those other high paid positions will have to go.

With fewer employees comes a [correspondingly](https://medium.com/@sushantvohra/your-boss-will-be-replaced-by-ai-before-you-do-91a8e7cca9fc) smaller [need](https://chatterhead.bearblog.dev/ai-will-replace-middle-management-not-hourly-workers/) for [middle-management](https://cmr.berkeley.edu/2021/01/middle-management-jobs/), allowing a company who executes well on this to benefit from a negative feedback loop in input costs without a comparable loss in output.

Eliminating most employees used to be out of the question, especially in tech where the workforce is mostly high IQ nerds with post-graduate STEM degrees, or ambitious autodidact generalists who are impressive enough without degrees.

The world is different now.

What a group of 10 or 20 could do in 2021, you can now accomplish with the best 1 or 2. 

And the definition of "best" has suddenly tipped dramatically in favor of the generalists over the specialists, even in highly specialized fields.

The AI apocalypse is real.

But its effects are stored as potential energy waiting to become kinetic.

And the physical law that unleashes that energy is the competition between established businesses and their newborn competitors.

The organizations that will die in the coming decade are the large risk-averse corporations.

Each large company that retains its current org chart, and simply adds an AI Strategy or AI Team in the hope of remaining relevant will be easy prey for smaller competitors who can execute the dramatic forms of cost-cutting this new technology enables.

There has perhaps never been a time in history when it suddenly became so easy to undercut so many large corporations, and to do so with a diffuse network of entrepreneurially minded developers, outside the bounds of a single corporate umbrella.

Reid Hoffman predicts that the traditional [9-to-5 job will be extinct](https://www.businesstoday.in/latest/corporate/story/9-to-5-jobs-are-doomed-linkedin-co-founder-reid-hoffman-predicts-their-end-by-2034-438837-2024-07-26) by 2034.

Such a dramatic prediction about the job market normally wouldn't be worth taking seriously.

Coming from founder of LinkedIn, it may merit some thought.

Hoffman's extinction of full time employment doesn't require any new surprise advances in technology in order to come true.

His prediction is simply that the entrepreneurs who survive the coming decade will be the ones who understand how to operate with as few full time employees as possible.

Either way, the old world is over.

We believe in building businesses in a different way.

At LD, our goal is to fundamentally change the economy.

Fortunately, we don't need one ounce of institutional power to achieve our goal.

AI is already fundamentally changing the economy in exactly the direction we want, and we aim to help your business move in that direction too.

Against the background of that change, there's a massive amount of untapped alpha in changing how organizations recruit, scale, and create.

We can achieve our goal easily, without changing the legal system, or the economic system, or the incentive structure of the world.

The world is heading in our direction already.

Come hang out.
