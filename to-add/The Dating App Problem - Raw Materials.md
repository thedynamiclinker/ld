The absolute state of dating apps defies description.

It is hard to find a more fundamental human need that is more pathetically under-served by every business in an entire worldwide industry.

We'll take the reader on a tour through the virtual storefronts in this economy, in the hope that you can see this problem from our perspective. Because once you see how retarded this space truly is, you can never unsee it, and you realize at last what everyone is doing wrong.

At the top, we have the "general purpose" apps.

They are distinguished from each other by scarcely a single feature.

## Tinder
The original swipe app.

## Boo
Boo's gimmick is Myers-Briggs types, plus a swipe app with some half-assed social networking.

## Bumble
Bumble is perhaps the worst idea of all time: an app where women must send the first message even after a symmetric swipe-based match procedure. Over 90% of women say they would prefer the man to approach first when they meet someone new in public. It is hardly surprising that the same dynamics carry over into a virtual space. Women match with men and then coyly allow the match to time out, waiting to be approached, despite top-down knowledge that this is impossible. Now, if the "women approach first" rule were a social norm imposed at a specific in-person event, like the [Sadie Hawkins dances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadie_Hawkins_dance) common in middle schools or high schools, then this coyness on behalf of the females could be seen as a reasonable test in which the men were expected to defy a minor social norm in order to express their interest in a specific woman. If Bumble, therefore, allowed women to message first but required men to pay $1 for each initiation, it would likely work phenomenally better, and the stock would not be down over 90% from its IPO as of this writing.
