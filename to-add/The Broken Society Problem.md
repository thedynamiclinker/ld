What do humans need most?

The most fundamental needs are:

Survival. (Shelter, Food, Work, Money.)

Mating. (Dating, Marriage, Children.)

Group. (Family, Friends, Community.)

All animals need the first two.

Humans, as a social species, need the third.

Our minds are designed to use the third 一 a small scale, tight knit coalition 一 as a foundation within which to find the first two.

Without a coalition 一 a group of humans of all ages who see each other every day and night 一 the human mind is lost at sea, hoping against hope to find the first two on one's own, in lonely pools of strangers on the worst apps on your phone, the hellscapes known by names like Tinder and LinkedIn.

This was not the world we signed up for.

Society no longer works. It got too big, and the internet made it orders of magnitude bigger.

We cannot fix society. We can, however, build something new, smaller, and most importantly, local.
