## Our Mission

Make the world a less lonely place.

This is not empty corporate speak.

We believe that every other business currently in existence is doing an absolutely pathetic job of this.

We apply this condemnation both to technological platforms like dating apps, career sites, and apps for meeting friends, as well as to physical locations like coffee shops, restaurants, and bars.

Pathetic. All of them. Every single one.

Not a single business in the average modern city gets better than an F rating in its ability to service the fundamental human need of meeting new people, and to do so in an environment that makes this as effortless as possible, given the constraints of human nature and the variations in personality between individuals.

We aim to convince the reader of this proposition, both by opening physical locations and building technological solutions which, in comparison, will make everything that came before appear childishly incompetent in servicing this fundamental human need.

## Why this Mission? An Answer from First Principles

Where are you supposed to meet new people these days?

This question is asked countless times a day, on every online platform.

Here's a small sample, containing over 100 posts asking some version of this question.

The skeptical reader is invited to read the posts in [[business/Where To Find People]].

Reading even a small number of such posts makes it undeniable that this is a fundamental problem of modern life.

So, where are we supposed to meet new people these days?

Let's consider the possible answers to this question from first principles.

Picture any business park or plaza with commercial real estate.

Not office buildings, but rather, all the places that look like this:

![[commercial-real-estate-1.jpg]]

Or this:

![[commercial-real-estate-2.jpg]]

Surely _some_ of the businesses in _some_ of these plazas are attempting to service the fundamental human need of meeting new people.

Let's see which ones are serving that need best.

First, notice that the majority of businesses in any such plaza are not viable candidates for a place to meet new people.

So first let's mentally delete the places that aren't social to begin with.

Cross out the grocery stores, convenience stores, pharmacies, chiropractors, massage parlors, salons, barbers, pet stores, and dentists.

(To be clear, of course it's _possible_ to meet new people at the dentist. But going to the dentist in an attempt to meet new people would be sufficient for a diagnosis of delusional over-optimism. Further, while it's perhaps easier to meet new people at the grocery store than at the dentist, grocery stores are in no way _designed_ to facilitate such meetings. Answering the question "Where am I supposed to meet people these days?" by suggesting that the confused party "Just approach people at the grocery store" is like telling a person who asks us "Where can I find food?" to just approach animals in the woods and hope for the best. Of course, that is possible. But its possibility in principles does not mean that the woods have been designed to make it easier, nor does it mean that the grocery stores or other businesses have intentionally designed their locations to service this fundamental human need.)

So, which businesses are left?

After we cross out all the obvious non-starters, we're left with one category:

The food and drink places.

So let's consider them.

Look at any coffee shop, restaurant, or bar.

The coffee shops look like this:

![[coffee-shop.jpg]]

Every food and drink business has the same problem.

They're places you go either (1) alone, or (2) with people you already know.

They're not places that you can easily meet new people. 

Look at any coffee shop, restaurant, or bar.

You'll see little groups of people who already knew each other when they came in.

You'll almost never see groups of people who met at that location.

The closest exception is the neighborhood bar.

But not everyone drinks.

So how do you design a place that makes it easy to meet new people, for everyone, morning noon and night?

Go back to that mental image of your local coffee shop, restaurant, or bar.

Picture all those people in the small groups that they came in with.

Picture a girl in the corner, looking at her phone.

Picture a guy on a laptop with his headphones in.

How do you take that exact mental image, and make the smallest possible change that will get those people talking to each other?

How do you break the imaginary walls between them, and make a place where it doesn't feel awkward to approach the small group, or the phone girl, or the laptop guy?

That's all you need to create a new kind of business that people will happily spend all day at.

Now, how do you get them spending money all day long, without worrying that they're spending too much?

You have to help them make money too, no matter what their jobs are.

You have to help them solve each other's problems, and use each other's knowledge.
