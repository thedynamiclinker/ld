Hi there.

Welcome to the company handbook.

Here we try to distill our thoughts into a set of principles for the various fields most relevant to AI and the future of tech.

We aim to make these principles as close to timeless laws as possible, though inevitably some of them will be approximations, half truths, or just plain wrong.

The sections below contain our thoughts on:
1. computing
2. business
3. humans
4. the meaning of life or w/e

Enjoy.
