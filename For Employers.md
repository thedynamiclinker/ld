- According to the IMF, [40% of global employment](https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2024/01/14/ai-will-transform-the-global-economy-lets-make-sure-it-benefits-humanity#:~:text=Many%20studies%20have%20predicted%20the,employment%20is%20exposed%20to%20AI.) is exposed to automation by AI.
- In advanced economies, it's [closer to 60%](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/fandd/issues/2024/06/Economic-possibilities-for-my-grandchildren-Kristalina-Georgieva#:~:text=But%20it%20also%20comes%20with,may%20simply%20be%20rendered%20obsolete.).
- The jobs most exposed are those of the [educated and highly paid](https://time.com/6961559/ethan-mollick-ai-apocalypse-essay/#:~:text=Educated%20and%20highly%20paid%20workers).
- All of these jobs are now a cost that your competitors will compete to cut.
- In a business with a 20% margin, every $1 in cost-cutting is worth $5 in sales.
- The largest cost in running a company is employees.

- With fewer employees comes [less](https://medium.com/@sushantvohra/your-boss-will-be-replaced-by-ai-before-you-do-91a8e7cca9fc) need [for](https://chatterhead.bearblog.dev/ai-will-replace-middle-management-not-hourly-workers/) middle [management](https://cmr.berkeley.edu/2021/01/middle-management-jobs/).
- It's now possible for many tech companies to eliminate the vast majority of both.
- Companies who execute this well can benefit from a negative feedback loop in input costs without a comparable loss in output.
- Doing without employees used to be out of the question, especially in tech, where the workforce is mostly advanced nerds with post-graduate STEM degrees, or ambitious autodidacts who are impressive enough without degrees.
- The world is different now.
- What a group of 10 or 20 could do in 2021, you can now accomplish with the best 1 or 2. 
- And the definition of "best" has suddenly tipped dramatically in favor of the generalists over the specialists, even in highly specialized fields.
- The AI apocalypse is here. But its effects are still mostly unrealized. The new world has arrived as potential energy waiting to become kinetic.
- The entrepreneurs who survive the coming decade will be the ones who understand how to operate at scale with as few full time employees as possible.
- As Ethan Mollick recently wrote in Time, the AI apocalypse we should worry about is not one of human extinction, but of the [many little apocalypses](https://time.com/6961559/ethan-mollick-ai-apocalypse-essay/#:~:text=It%20opens%20us%20up%20to%20many%20little%20apocalypses%2C%20as%20jobs%20and%20workplaces%20are%20disrupted%20one%2Dby%2Done%20in%20ways%20that%20change%20lives%20and%20livelihoods.) of every company that fails to rethink every level of its organization.
- The organizations that will die in the coming decade are the large risk-averse corporations that retain their current org chart, and simply add an AI Strategy or AI Team in the hope of staying relevant.
- These organizations will be easy prey for smaller competitors who can execute the dramatic forms of cost-cutting this new technology enables.

- If you're interested in doing more with less, we can help.
