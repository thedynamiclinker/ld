This is a less conventional addition to the business plan in [[business/Where To Find People]].

In this page, we will outline our longer term goals for the business, both in our intentions for the physical locations, and for the technology wing that we intend to direct resources toward once the first physical locations are established.

The unifying theme of all parts of our business is the goal of tacking the problems of loneliness and social isolation that are so prevalent in modern life, and doing so in a way that is not currently offered by any existing business.

## Long Term Business Plan

We plan to develop the business in stages, each of which must be profitable.

We begin with a familiar business model: a small shop offering coffee, food, wine & beer.

We will then iteratively modify this business model in minor ways, each designed to expand the geographic scope of the business, and the loyalty and devotion of its regulars.

We eventually arrive at a technology company that aims to steal a majority of market share from all existing dating apps, career apps, and social networks.

We aim to reach this point without taking any risks that have a significant chance of allowing investments to "go to zero." In other words, we intend to deliver profits early, on a relatively small investment, and to "fail like an escalator" at each stage as we iteratively modify the business model.

An initial draft of the long term plan is as follows.

## Stage 0: Prehistory

The reader can skip this stage and proceed to [[#Stage 1 Foundation Era|Stage 1: Foundation Era]] without missing any key ideas.

Stage 0 is a normal restaurant and bar. This is chosen as the foundation for the creative ideas that follow, due to its extreme familiarity and total lack of creativity.

### Goal
Rent a ~2000 sq ft retail location, get a California type 41 beer & wine license and the required permits for operating a bar and restaurant, and open for business.

### Cost
$3-5k/mo rent + $7k one time cost for the type 41 license and lawyer's fees + cost of renovations + cost of a keggerator, refrigerators, bar, barstools, and decorations.

### Worst case outcome
Break even or lose money slowly. Non-transferrable investments like renovations to the physical location will be unrecoverable. Transferable investments like the bar equipment are typically purchased used by most businesses, and should be partially recoverable by selling them on the secondary market. The downside is minimal provided the upfront non-transferrable investment is limited.

### Expected outcome
Once the location is rented, we expect to spend 3-4 months waiting for the type 42 alcohol license to be approved (based on discussions with a lawyer), and we intent to carry out any required renovations and decorations during that time.

## Stage 1: Foundation Era

### Goal
Whenever a customer arrives, if we don't recognize them, we tell them the rules.

Our business has one rule: You're not allowed to buy your own drinks.

If you want anything, you have to talk to someone.

You can offer to get theirs while they get yours, or any other agreement. But you can't just buy something for yourself and look at your phone without engaging with other customers.

Same deal applies to food and coffee and everything else we sell.

Nothing you buy in the establishment is allowed to be consumed by you.

That's the only rule.

### Cost
Free. However, we believe an additional small overhead will be worth the cost. Namely, whenever it's someone's first time, the owners buy them their first drink or small food item for no cost, as an introduction to the rules. That way, everyone's first experience with the idea is getting something for free, and customers who don't like the idea still received something for free, making them less likely to complain online or to friends.

### Worst case outcome
It turns out that people value the novel idea less than they value having all N businesses in society permit the purchase of things for oneself, rather than only N-1 of such businesses. Convert to normal bar and restaurant, and give up hope on humanity. Minimal financial downside, since we still have a normal bar and restaurant.

### Expected outcome
Based on preliminary exploration, we expect the idea will rapidly develop an enthusiastic following among individuals who would like to meet people in public, but feel uncomfortable doing so, given modern social norms.

The average modern city currently contains exactly zero buildings where you can be confident that any other person inside the building is open to being approached and meeting strangers. As of 2025, 50% of single men aged 18 to 30 have not approached a woman in the past year. When asked, the most common reason cited is that they're unsure whether any given girl they see in public is open to being approached, or whether she would see them as creepy or weird. However, 90% of females in the same age range claim that they would prefer for the guy to approach first when meeting someone new in public. In other words, all that is needed is a social context in which one's presence is equivalent to one's willingness to meet strangers. The same reasoning applies to the difficulty of meeting strangers for platonic friendships. While such an assurance is present in a few ephemeral groups that exist for domain-specific purposes (e.g., speed dating, Meetup groups), there is no permanent location in the average modern city in which one's presence implies the willingness to be approached by strangers and engage socially. We aim to be such a location. 

## Stage 2: Trivia Era

### Goal
The rule that no one can buy their own drinks establishes us as a location focused on social engagement between the patrons. People who don't like the idea don't return, and people enthusiastic about the idea become regulars.

We then add stronger incentives for the patrons to learn more details about each other. 

Trivia nights are common at bars. We intend to do the same, but instead of trivia about world history or current events, our trivia questions will focus on the regulars who happen to be in attendance that night.

As the owners and bartenders get to know the regulars, we may learn, for example, that:

- One regular named Jim flew across the Atlantic on a propeller airplane during his time in the Air Force.
- Another regular named David followed the Grateful Dead around and did a bunch of LSD.
- A newcomer named Steven has recently been trying Ketamine therapy and has had very positive experiences with it so far.

The owners and bartenders will ask permission from each such regular prior to including a given fact in our trivia.[^1]

[^1]: These are all real examples from the founders' recent interactions with real people at local bars, after buying them drinks and explaining the idea.

### Cost
We intend to spend an unusually large amount on these trivia events, and hold them regularly, ideally 2-3 times per week. Over any given time period, approximately 10-20% of the business's profits will be distributed to customers who rank in the top 5 of a given trivia event.

### Worst case outcome
This doesn't catch on, and we end up with the novel twist on a tested business model established in Stage 1: A unique form of business, known for the rule that no one is allowed to buy their own drinks. Depending on the profitably of Stage 1, we can open more locations focused on that simple idea even if Stage 2 fails entirely, and test new ideas from there while abandoning Stage 2.

### Expected outcome
Given the relatively large amounts that we intend to distribute to the top 5 ranked participants in any given trivia event, we expect this will make the guests accustomed to not just being socially rewarded, but actually making money in exchange for learning more and more about one another. In addition, the existence of the trivia mechanism gives customers social permission to ask one another for more details about each other's past and present life, without worrying that they'll seem too forthright. "Trivia night" is the perfect plausibly deniable excuse for slightly overstepping a conversational partner's current level of comfortable disclosure. This will create a constant positive pressure toward normalizing emotionally positive vulnerability and mutual disclosure of one's most interesting personal stories and attributes to other members, as well as an incentive to learn the same about others. We expect this addition to the establishment's laws of social physics will build what had been a loose coalition of regulars into a tight knit social in-group, and do so much more rapidly than any other existing business model that presently exists in the average modern city.

## Step 3: Blue Era

### Goal
At this point, we intend to fund the creation of a web and mobile app that would be difficult or impossible to create without the tight-knit coalitions above, and their weekly drive to learn as much about one another as possible with the help of an ancient social lubricant.

The result of the trivia era is that a large quantity of [[Implicit Attribute|implicit attributes]] of the individual participants have been [[Information Mining|mined]], thus providing a potential solution to the [[The Implicit Attributes Problem]].

(See links for background on the problems and terminology mentioned above.)

To our knowledge, this would be the first attempt in history to provide a global solution to the [[The Implicit Attributes Problem]].

By incentivising [[Information Mining]] in the quantities described above, we aim to enable the creation of a new kind of social search app that taps into an immeasurably deeper set of individual-specific information than any existing app for any social purpose. We aim to make each such (previously implicit) attribute opt-in for global searchability by each participant, and to allow others anywhere in the world to find the individuals in question based on those opt-in attributes without publishing them to any public profile or bio.

### Cost
Should be able to launch this with 10 engineers and 1 year of development, as an absolute worst case scenario. The design is essentially opt-in publication of a user defined string to a private embedding database, and an interface that allows users to embed a query and perform a soft search against the implicit attributes they're looking for.

If this doesn't make sense, that's ok. No app in existence comes anywhere near being able to achieve this yet, and we're still working on developing the right terminology to describe it. But imagine being able to find the kind of people you're looking for, using criteria that they've never taken the time to write down or post online on any bio, but which may be exactly the property of them that makes them the kind of person you're looking for.

### Worst Case
None.

### Expected Outcome
A less lonely world, will the small scale tight-knit social groups that our brains evolved to be hungry for, and the ability to find people globally outside your local social group using criteria not presently searchable on any existing app, because nobody would ever think to put them in a profile.

That is, infinitely less loneliness, in your local community, and in your global ability to find the kind of people you're looking for.

In other words, a solution to this problem, for all definitions of "blue."
