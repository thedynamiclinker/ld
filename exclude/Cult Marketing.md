Initial exploration of the idea has shown two very distinct types of interest.

First, we have received uniformly curious interest from the average patron of various local bars at which we've been conducting market research. Given the novelty of the idea, nearly everyone we've spoken with has expressed interest in visiting such an establishment at least once.

However, much more importantly, we have received an extremely intense and qualitatively different form of interest from roughly 20% of the individuals we've spoken with. All of these individuals agree strongly with the statement that "It's very hard to meet new people these days." Many of these individuals drink but do not often attend bars, since (in their own words) they are more interested in meeting "real friends," "close connections, or "actual people," and less interested in the sort of smalltalk and superficial mingling that is standard at sports bars, live music events, speed dating, meetup groups centered around shared interests, or other situations in which extroversion is high but depth of connection is low. 

This latter group of individuals has expressed a level of interest in the idea that verges on the manic. The impression one gets from talking to these people is that the mere existence of a business in which the rules not only _allow_ talking to strangers but virtually _require_ it would give them a form of "permission" that no existing business does, and in doing so would solve a major problem in their lives. These individuals range from somewhat extroverted to extremely introverted. Some, primarily younger females, have complained that "guys don't talk to girls anymore," and "I hate meeting people online." Others, mostly males in their early 20s to late 40s, have expressed that it is more difficult to initiate a conversation with anyone in public these days without seeming weird or creepy. Many of these individuals have a social desire to meet strangers, but have complained that these days everyone in public is either (1) on their phone, (2) on a laptop, (3) listening to headphones, or (4) in a group of friends. It seems that many young men in the 21-49 age range have simply given up. These individuals appear to be no more or less social than anyone else, nor do they seem any more or less attractive than average. Their distinguishing feature appears to be higher than average conscientiousness. In other words, they have both the social energy and a strong desire to meet people, but since they have an equally strong desire not to be perceived as weird or creepy, they fail to overcome the hurdle of initiating conversation.

Against this background, we expect to draw two types of customers, which for brevity we will call (1) "The moderately curious," and (2) "The true believers."

Our external marketing and brand identity will aim to target the individuals in category (2), while our internal decor and customer experience aims to also be comfortable for individuals in category (1).

Given the above, we intend to draw inspiration from Stone Brewing and similar companies in its approach to brand identity.

Stone Brewing, another company founded in the Escondido / San Marcos area, has grown to an international powerhouse by following an approach to branding and marketing that is highly unusual, but well understood by psychologists.

The back of a typical bottle of Stone contains a long paragraph in small font, typically insulting the reader in a bombastic but playful way.

The text on the back of their Arrogant Bastard ale is as follows.

However, when one visits Stone Brewing Co in Escondido, one is not confronted by a hostess that insults the customer like the back of a Stone beer bottle.

Such businesses exist, most famously "Dick's Last Resort" ä¸€ a fun novelty restaurant common in tourist heavy areas. At Dick's, the gimmick is that the wait staff insults the customers and treats them poorly on purpose.

In contrast, Stone Brewing does not take this approach at their physical location. 

Their approach is instead "Dick's Last Resort" on the back of their bottles, and a pleasant place to visit for food and drinks, in person.

We intend to take inspiration from the approach of Stone Brewing, in order to appeal to the two very distinct types of customer we expect to attract.

Here is one of several designs of business card we have recently begun handing out at local bars, coffee shops, and universities.

The verbiage is extreme, but it is exactly the type of content that we have found appeals to the individuals who we expect will become our most devoted regular customers. Though this crowd doesn't like to be called customers, and we think they deserve a better term too. The people who are drawn to this type of content are turned off by corporate speak, and drawn to interactions that are raw, real, unvarnished, and unafraid.

The admittedly extreme verbiage in the business card below is exactly what is required to convince this type of person that we're serious about what we do, and that we aren't just another interchangeable business that opts for a boring risk-averse brand identity, rather than being willing to stand out and stand up for what they are.

The technique employed above is well understood by psychologists and marketing experts.

It follows exactly the principles laid out in Jodi Raynsford's famous book on "How to Start a Cult." The book is not about religious cults, but about branding and marketing.

Its thesis is that brand loyalty no longer works how it used to, and it makes a case that its "cult principles" are those that work most effectively to inspire devotion and loyalty in the highly competitive environment of modern business, where attention is the scarce resource for which all businesses must compete.

Although we could surely fill a book with statistics and examples on our approach to branding and marketing, we will now move on to other issues. We're happy to answer any additional questions on the topic of branding, as needed.

Now, let's get back to the rest of the business plan.
