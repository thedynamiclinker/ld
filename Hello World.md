Welcome to LD.

We're a new kind of company, for a new kind of world.

What kind of world?

- According to the IMF, almost [40% of global employment](https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2024/01/14/ai-will-transform-the-global-economy-lets-make-sure-it-benefits-humanity#:~:text=Many%20studies%20have%20predicted%20the,employment%20is%20exposed%20to%20AI.) is exposed to automation by AI.

- In advanced economies, it's [closer to 60%](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/fandd/issues/2024/06/Economic-possibilities-for-my-grandchildren-Kristalina-Georgieva#:~:text=But%20it%20also%20comes%20with,may%20simply%20be%20rendered%20obsolete.).

- Your job is most at risk if you're [educated and highly paid](https://time.com/6961559/ethan-mollick-ai-apocalypse-essay/#:~:text=Educated%20and%20highly%20paid%20workers).


How do we know all this isn't just hype?

Well, there _is_ a lot of hype about AI now, and about half of it is justified.

Reid Hoffman predicts that the traditional [9-to-5 job will be extinct](https://www.businesstoday.in/latest/corporate/story/9-to-5-jobs-are-doomed-linkedin-co-founder-reid-hoffman-predicts-their-end-by-2034-438837-2024-07-26) by 2034.

Such a dramatic prediction about the job market normally wouldn't be worth taking seriously.

Coming from founder of LinkedIn, it may merit some thought.

Your business still makes sense, but your org chart probably doesn't.

In a business with a 20% margin, every $1 in cost-cutting is worth $5 in sales. And the largest cost in running a company is employees.

The jobs most subject to automation turn out to be the jobs that no one ever really loved, but kept anyway because they paid well. Mostly elite white collar work.

With fewer employees comes a [correspondingly](https://medium.com/@sushantvohra/your-boss-will-be-replaced-by-ai-before-you-do-91a8e7cca9fc) smaller [need](https://chatterhead.bearblog.dev/ai-will-replace-middle-management-not-hourly-workers/) for [middle-management](https://cmr.berkeley.edu/2021/01/middle-management-jobs/), allowing a company who executes well on this to benefit from a negative feedback loop in input costs without a comparable loss in output.

We'll finish this page later. For now, we have to go do a thing.
