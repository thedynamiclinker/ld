Welcome to LD.

We're a new kind of company, for a new kind of world.

We're AI developers. It's our job to automate high paid white collar jobs.
So recently we quit those jobs and started a business, to help your business.

There's a lot of hype about AI now, and about half of it is justified.
Your business still makes sense, but your org chart probably doesn't.

There are positions in that org chart you're paying a premium for.
Most of them can now be replaced for a fraction of the cost.

We specialize in eliminating elite white collar employees, for employers.
And in helping underpaid employees become new entrepreneurs.

Why?

Because startups that used to need 20 employees can now get by with 2.
It's ok if you don't believe us. Your competitors do.

So our goal is to make sure your business doesn't die, as your competitors learn how to cut costs with AI.

We modernize businesses, by working with founders and teams to help you scale up in output, and scale down in cost.

We started LD because the AI apocalypse is here, but it doesn't have to be the dystopia we all fear.

There's never been a worse time to be an employee.
There's never been a better time to start a business.

We automate jobs for a living, so we know what we can and can't do.
We have no ability to automate entrepreneurs or blue collar workers.

We can't replace your plumber or your electrician.

Or the Cambodian lady who owns the sandwich shop down the street, with the long line out the door at 4am of all the contractors who woke up early and have to eat.

We can't replace your company's CEO or COO.

But a lot of those other high paid positions will have to go.

We're devoting our lives to eliminating elite white collar jobs.

The jobs that no one ever really loved, but kept anyway because they paid well.

So if you're a business owner who wants to scale up sales and cut costs,

or a disillusioned employee who dreams of being your own boss,

but never got started because you never knew how, we're here to tell you both:

You deserve a better life than the one you're living now.

You deserve to be your own boss and kick ass and get paid.

And we'd love to help those among you who aren't afraid.

#### Price

You work hard for your money. Probably harder than we do. So we have one rule when it comes to what we charge you.

We work for free, at first.

We believe that in business, as in dating, long term is better.

We're expensive, once you need us, because what we do becomes more valuable at a nonlinear rate as a client becomes more serious about what we offer.

In a business with 20% margin, every $1 saved on input costs is worth $5 in sales.

For each dollar thus saved, the margin of the business increases.

Since our business model is increasing the margin of your business, the value of our services strongly depends on how serious a business owner is about cutting input costs and growing output.

Because of that, we can afford to be picky. And we can afford to be weird.

We're not for everyone. That's ok. You're cool. We like you anyway.

But we have high standards in who we work with long term day to day.

So in the beginning, we're happy to cover the cost of the dinners, drinks, or flights.

The best relationships always come from unexpected places.

And we love humans more than anything.

So whoever you are, we'd love to hear from you.

Come say hi.
