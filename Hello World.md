Welcome to LD.

We're a new kind of company, for a new kind of world.

What new kind of world?

- According to the IMF, almost [40% of global employment](https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2024/01/14/ai-will-transform-the-global-economy-lets-make-sure-it-benefits-humanity#:~:text=Many%20studies%20have%20predicted%20the,employment%20is%20exposed%20to%20AI.) is exposed to automation by AI.

- In advanced economies, it's [closer to 60%](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/fandd/issues/2024/06/Economic-possibilities-for-my-grandchildren-Kristalina-Georgieva#:~:text=But%20it%20also%20comes%20with,may%20simply%20be%20rendered%20obsolete.).

- Your job is most at risk if you're [educated and highly paid](https://time.com/6961559/ethan-mollick-ai-apocalypse-essay/#:~:text=Educated%20and%20highly%20paid%20workers).

- Reid Hoffman predicts that the traditional [9-to-5 job will be extinct](https://www.businesstoday.in/latest/corporate/story/9-to-5-jobs-are-doomed-linkedin-co-founder-reid-hoffman-predicts-their-end-by-2034-438837-2024-07-26) by 2034.

How do we know all this isn't just hype?

---

Well, there _is_ a lot of hype about AI now, and about half of it is justified.

Your business still makes sense, but your org chart probably doesn't.

There are positions in that org chart you're paying a premium for. Most of them can now be replaced for a fraction of the cost.

Startups that used to need 20 employees can now get by with 2. 

 We're AI developers. It's our job to automate highly paid jobs. So recently we quit those jobs and started a business, to help your business.

We specialize in eliminating jobs for employers, and in helping current employees become new entrepreneurs.

We started LD because the AI apocalypse is here, but it doesn't have to be the dystopia we all fear.

There's a reason to be optimistic about the AI apocalypse. The jobs most subject to automation turn out to be the jobs that no one ever really loved, but kept anyway because they paid well. Elite white collar work. A world with less of those jobs will look different, but we believe it can be a better world for everyone.

So if you're a business owner who wants to scale up sales and cut costs, or a disillusioned employee who dreams of being your own boss, but never got started because you never knew how, you both deserve better than the life you're living now. You deserve to be your own boss and kick ass and get paid. And we'd love to help those among you who aren't afraid.
