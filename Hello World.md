Hi there,

Welcome to LD.

We're a simple company, with a simple goal.

To build a pro-human AI apocalypse.

What does that mean?

Well, we're AI developers.
That's what we do, day to day.
And because of our job, a lot of other jobs are going away.
So eventually we quit our old jobs and started this.

Most AI companies these days are doing a small number of things. 

They're either:
- Building some uninspiring B2B SaaS app, or
- Training new models with no clear business model, or
- Making API calls to a remote Superintelligence in the sky, or
- Trying to make the new Superintelligences "safe" (without defining danger), or
- Other stuff that a thousand similar companies are doing.

All these business models have one thing in common.

They're all trying to usher in the (inevitable) AI apocalypse.

They're not trying to make the (inevitable) post-apocalypse more human.

Now, to be fair, we're AI developers too.

But we approach the problem differently.

Our approach is to ask:

In a future full of AI:
- What would still suck about being human?
- What would we wish existed, but not have?
- What would make life dramatically better for little cost?

Solving these problems isn't as ambitious as it sounds.

We aren't trying to solve world hunger, eliminate poverty, or go to mars.

The things that make life better on the average day aren't impossible to find.

They're things like "being able to find the kind of humans you're looking for," which is still pretty damn hard despite all the social/dating/career apps.

They're things like "having your own business instead of working for someone else," and having all the autonomy and meaning-of-life that implies.

They're things like "getting paid to be the most passionate and real version of yourself, rather than having to fit into the manufactured culture of that job you secretly hate."

Our company's goal is to build things that make human life better, in a world where:
- Full time employment becomes harder and harder to find.
- Companies cut 90% of their white-collar jobs.
- Freelancing or contracting or small-scale entrepreneurship become the default for most workers.

We used to think this future sounded pretty bleak.

Now we think it's the best future we can imagine.

But to make that future great, we need to build some tools for you.

We're extreme capitalists, and we believe the most financially viable business model is to help as many people as possible achieve what they want most. Sometimes that means helping business owners dramatically cut costs by replacing human labor with automation, so they can keep their business alive. Other times it means helping employees who hate their job to start a business they believe in for the first time. But one thing it always means is saying no to good contracts with good clients who only want incremental change.

We specialize in major changes, for white-collar employers and employees. Though this service may sound vague or ill-defined, we can offer it service because for the first time in history, we have access to a technology that allows us to automate a large number of the highest paid jobs. If you get paid to sit at a desk and use a computer, automating your job is our area of expertise. We have no ability to replace your plumber or your electrician. But we can easily help you scale your tech startup with a smaller team. AI is transforming the economy, and we're here to help it change. With our help, we believe you're capable of doing more with less.

Here at LD, we love humans. But that puts us in an unfortunate place when its comes to marketing. Because every lame-ass company in the world tries to act like they care about humans. And the last thing we want to do is to sound like those assholes. So we think a better vibe for us is to sound like, idk, terrorists, or something bad, on the outside, and then be secretly nice and pro-human and love you weirdos behind the scenes. I mean christ, aren't you tired of how everyone tries to seem all nice and moral on the outside and keeps their best juicy secrets all hidden? Of course you are. We are too. So here's the vibes we've settled on, business wise, for you...

Inverse Marketing.â„¢

We try to look evil/incompetent/naive/immoral/misanthropic on the outside, and then we do our best to be good decent people behind the scenes.

Because the alternative has been tried, and let's be real, we're all sick of it.

So here at LD, our company values are as follows:

- We WANT to automate away all your 9-to-5 jobs.
- We WANT to help your boss fire 90% of your company's highest paid workers (including you).
- We WANT to help you start a business of your own where our company pays your company to do whatever you love most and do best, so you never have to answer to anyone else again (except your customers (including us)).

That's the path we've taken, and we want to help you take it too.

Because it isn't up to us.

And it isn't up to you.

The new world is here.

And the above is the only way to prepare for what's coming.

Still not sick of us?

What a coincidence! We're enjoying you too.
