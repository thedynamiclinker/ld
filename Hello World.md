Welcome to LD.

We're a new kind of company, for a new kind of world.

We specialize in making sure your business doesn't die,
as your competitors learn how to cut costs with AI.

We're AI developers. It's our job to automate high paid white collar jobs.
So recently we quit those jobs and started a business, to help your business.

There's a lot of hype about AI now, and about half of it is justified.
Your business still makes sense, but your org chart probably doesn't.

There are positions in that org chart you're paying a premium for.
Most of them can now be replaced for a fraction of the cost.

We specialize in eliminating white collar employees, for employers.
And in helping former employees become new entrepreneurs.

There's never been a worse time to be an employee.
There's never been a better time to start a business.

Startups that used to need 20 employees can now get by with 2.
It's ok if you don't believe us. Your competitors do.

We started LD because the AI apocalypse is here,
but it doesn't have to be the dystopia we all fear.

We automate jobs for a living, so we know what we can and can't do.
We have no ability to automate entrepreneurs or blue collar workers.

We can't replace your plumber or your electrician.
Or the Cambodian lady who owns the donut shop down the street.

We can't replace your company's CEO or COO.
But a lot of those other high paid positions will have to go.

We're devoting our lives to eliminating elite white collar jobs.
The ones you never really loved, but kept anyway because they paid well.

If you're a business owner who wants to cut costs,
or a disillusioned employee who dreams of being your own boss,
but never got started because you never knew how,
we're here to tell you both:

You deserve better than the life you're living now.
So we're devoting our lives to helping you chase your dreams.
To be your own boss, and kick ass, and get paid.

But we only want to hear from those of you who aren't afraid.
