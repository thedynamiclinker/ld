## Low Tech

Given the loneliness and social isolation that plague [[The Modern World]],

Our mission is to solve [[The Social Schelling Point Problem]],

And in doing so, to answer the question of [[Where To Find People]].

We claim that this problem can be solved by a business with a built-in [[Justified Icebreaker]].

This is the missing ingredient that currently plagues all physical locations that claim to be a [[The Third Place|Third Place]].

Solving this problem requires opening a new category of business, like [[The Internet|this one]] and [[The Other Place|this one]].

We are currently working to open such locations.

## High Tech

The existence of these locations is a key pre-requisite that will enable us to attack a much more pernicious disease of modern life: [[The Implicit Attributes Problem]].

By using a combination of technology and the physical locations described above, we aim to perform [[Information Mining]] and storage of [[Implicit Attribute|Implicit Attributes]] in an opt-in manner, and in doing so, to create an embedding based search of a far richer set of information than can be represented in any online profile, and to do so without requiring that information to be published in natural language in any publicly visible way.

## WTF did I just read?
Sorry. Sometimes you need to coin new terms to talk about new ideas. But to put it more simply: We're building physical locations where it's not awkward to meet new people, and tech that lets you find the kind of people you're looking for, using more than just pictures and some words in a profile. Because it's pretty damn hard to meet new people these days. So we're working on fixing that, both in person and online.
