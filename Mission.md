## Mission Statement

The modern world is a desperately lonely place. We believe this is not an inevitable result of human psychology, nor of capitalism, nor of mental health, or microplastics, or pharmaceutical drugs, or smartphones (though this is the closest one to a proper culprit), or any of the other things commonly blamed for this problem.

We believe the loneliness of modern life is a direct consequence of the nonexistence of a certain class of business.

It is those businesses that we aim to create. We intend to do so, because we believe that every other business currently in existence is pathetically failing to address this problem.

But first, let's state more completely the nature of the problem.

## Problem Statement

Where are you supposed to meet new people these days?

This question is asked [[Where To Find People|countless times]] a day, on every online platform.

Let's consider the possible answers.

Picture any business park or plaza. The places that look like this:

![[commercial-real-estate-1.jpg]]

Now mentally delete the places that aren't social to begin with.

Cross out the grocery stores, convenience stores, pharmacies, chiropractors, massage parlors, salons, barbers, pet stores, and dentists.[^1]

[^1]: To be clear, of course it's _possible_ to meet new people at the dentist. But going to the dentist in an attempt to meet new people would be sufficient for a diagnosis of delusional over-optimism. Grocery stores may be a better place to approach strangers, but that does not mean those businesses have been designed to service that need.

So, which businesses are left, after we cross out all the obvious non-starters?

In the average business plaza, we're left with one category:

The food and drink places.

So let's examine them.

Consider any coffee shop, restaurant, or bar in the average modern city.

The coffee shops look like this:

The restaurants look like this:

The bars come in several varieties, but the majority are either:

Night clubs or party locations, like this:

![[nightclub-1.jpg]]

Breweries or tasting rooms, where the focus is almost entirely on the beer or wine itself.

Every one of these businesses has the same problem.

They're places you go either (1) alone, or (2) with people you already know.

They're not places that you can easily meet new people.[^2]

[^2]: It is worth taking a moment to further elaborate on the claim that nightclubs and live music events are not optimized to solve the problem of meeting new people. Night clubs, live music events, and party focused bars -- the bars more likely to have louder music and dim lights -- are well optimized for something, but that something is not meeting new people. They give the patrons a limited category of excuse to gently exceed the social norms and boundaries that are the default outside. They do this by providing a plausibly deniable excuse to push past everyday social norms of personal space and physical closeness. For example, needing to lean in closer in order to be heard by one's date because the music is too loud, needing to be physically closer because the density of people is so high that there is no alternative, the presence of dim lights, not to mention all the obvious social lubricant functions of alcohol. We would argue that the fundamental human need of meeting new people is infinitely broader than anything that is provided by these nightclubs or party style bars. Leaving aside the fact that not everyone drinks, these locations are nowhere near a general solution to that problem, even for those who do.

In every single coffee shop or restaurant, you'll see the same social structure.

Little groups of people who already knew each other when they came in.

You'll almost never see groups of people who met at that location.

The closest exception is the neighborhood bar, which tends to look something like this:

![[neighborhood-bar-1.jpg]]


These locations tend to have brighter lights and quieter music than the nightclub variety. They tend to serve more standardized beers and wines, unlike the artisanal craft breweries and tasting rooms. They are the closest thing to a business that is optimized for meeting new people. And yet even these places fail miserably to solve that problem in general.

First of all, not everyone drinks.

Second of all, even for those who do drink, the human desire to meet new people goes far beyond the times of day when one is interested in drinking alcohol.

So how do you design a place that makes it easy to meet new people, for everyone, morning noon and night?

Go back to that mental image of your local coffee shop, restaurant, or bar.

Picture all those people in the small groups that they came in with.

Picture a girl in the corner, looking at her phone.

Picture a guy on a laptop with his headphones in.

How do you take that exact mental image, and make the smallest possible change that will get those people talking to each other?

How do you break the imaginary walls between them, and make a place where it doesn't feel awkward to approach the small group, or the phone girl, or the laptop guy?

This is precisely the problem we intend to solve.
