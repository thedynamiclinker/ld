## The Book of Tech

![[sudo-code.png]]
<span style="text-align: center; display: block"><i>Or: Who we want to pay</i></span>

- As developers, we all try to learn at work.
- Yet 90% of startups fail.
- The implications of this fact are largely unrecognized.
- It suggests that most of what developers learn at work is a recipe for failure.
- Listen to the beliefs of the most successful developers in history.
- You'll notice a surprising amount of agreement between them.
- But their beliefs are wildly opposed to how most tech teams are run.
- Our technical handbook is a curriculum based on the wisdom of these top developers.
- This curriculum is our guide for the developers and companies we work with.
- In short, we do things differently.
- These differences are not simply personal quirks or lack of experience.
- They're lessons we've learned from the best developers in history.
- Their lessons and stories are the roots of the our culture.
- Come get root.

## The Book of Business

<span style="text-align: center; display: block"><i>Or: How we want to pay you</i></span>

- Do you hate your job?
- Do you think it's just ok, but dream of something better?
- Do you envy the Cambodian lady who sells donuts down the street, because even she knows how to run a business and had the balls to get started so you look at her and think "Why the hell don't I know how?"
- What's keeping you stuck, always on the verge of taking action but never quite feeling ready.
- I'm here to tell you.
- Here's why you're stuck.
- Nobody actually knows what's legal anymore.
- Society got big.
- There are too many laws.
- And the laws are hard to read.
- So how is anyone supposed to start a business these days?
- What are you supposed to do?
- Learn ALL the laws?
- Have a 7000 point business plan?
- Beg for seed funding?
- Ask for money from friends and family?
- C corp S corp LLC partnership?
- Fuck that noise.
- There are a lot of you out there who would be way better at running a business than a lot these goofballs out there who are running them now.
- There are also a lot of us who only know how to learn by trying stuff and failing. 
- Failing over and over and over until the scar tissue starts to look like knowledge if you squint.
- So how are we supposed to learn through failure without losing everything, going bankrupt, or accidentally breaking all those laws we still didn't read?
- I'll tell you how.
- Follow me.
- We're starting right now.
- Not later.
- Now.

## The Book of Humans

<span style="text-align: center; display: block"><i>Or: How we organize</i></span>

- In the old world, we had this term: "Software Engineering."
- In the new world, we realized engineering is the wrong metaphor.
- Planning a software project is nothing like building a bridge.
- The vast majority of our productive hours as developers are spent doing things we _don't yet know how to do._
- The unknowns developers face during the majority of our productive hours are best conceptualized as an enemy to be defeated by any means available.
- Add a business dimension, and we get another adversary: Any current or future startup that manages to build the same thing as us, for less money, in less time, while matching or exceeding us in quality is an adversary whose potential existence should be a focal point around which all our planning and organizational decisions revolve. 
- The game theoretic structure of a dev team is therefore entirely unlike engineering.
- We wouldn't plan a chess match or a fist fight in Jira.
- We wouldn't plan our moves two weeks at a time in paintball, football, or Go.
- Software development + Team dynamics + Business dynamics = The game theoretic logic of competitive team sports, but a more serious sort of sport on which one's livelihood depends.
- Fortunately the human mind has a deep ancestral familiarity with this logic.
- The Right Way™ to organize a group of humans toward this end is to use the most ancient battle-tested form of collective action in our species' ancestral repertoire.
- Or in short:

<span style="text-align: center; display: block">Plan Like War.™</span>

- In this book, we express our approach to team management.
- We assemble over two millenia of wisdom in the strategies of cooperation and conflict, and distill these stories into a list of timeless principles for organizing and motivating large groups of humans toward a shared goal.
- We believe the principles thus distilled offer a more effective set of tools for managing and motivating large teams than the Pro(du|je)ct Managerial class's tired form of agile-scrum that currently infects and demoralizes the best developers on so many tech teams.
- Of course we know, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72qxqv34DqE) [means](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Wh66FXZJQ) [war](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhSy-6VqIww).
- Join the fight.
