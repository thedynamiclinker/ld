## The Book of Tech

![[sudo-code.png]]

- As developers, we all try to learn at work.
- Yet 90% of startups fail.
- The implications of this fact are largely unrecognized.
- It suggests that most of what developers learn at work is a recipe for failure.
- Listen to the beliefs of the most successful developers in history.
- You'll notice a surprising amount of agreement between them.
- But their beliefs are wildly opposed to how most tech teams are run.
- Our technical handbook is a curriculum based on the wisdom of these top developers.
- This curriculum as a guide for the developers and companies we work with.
- In short, we do things differently.
- These differences are not simply personal quirks or lack of experience.
- They're lessons we've learned from the best developers in history.
- Their lessons and stories are the roots of the our culture.
- Come get root.

## The Book of Business

![[abraham-linkin.png|200]]

- Do you hate your job?
- Do you think it's just ok, but dream of something better?
- Do you envy the Cambodian lady who sells donuts down the street, because even she knows how to run a business and had the balls to get started so you look at her and think "Why the hell don't I know how?"
- What's keeping you stuck, always on the verge of taking action but never quite feeling ready.
- I'm here to tell you.
- Here's why you're stuck.
- Nobody actually knows what's legal anymore.
- Society got big.
- There are too many laws.
- And the laws are hard to read.
- So how is anyone supposed to start a business these days?
- What are you supposed to do?
- Learn ALL the laws?
- Have a 7000 point business plan?
- Beg for seed funding?
- Ask for money from friends and family?
- C corp S corp LLC partnership?
- Fuck that noise.
- There are a lot of you out there who would be way better at running a business than a lot these goofballs out there who are running them now.
- There are also a lot of us who only know how to learn by trying stuff and failing. 
- Failing over and over and over until the scar tissue starts to look like knowledge if you squint.
- So how are we supposed to learn through failure without losing everything, going bankrupt, or accidentally breaking all those laws we still didn't read?
- I'll tell you how.
- Follow me.
- We're starting right now.
- Not later.
- Now.

## The Book of Humans

![[softwar.png]]

- In the old world, we had this term: "Software Engineering."
- In the new world, we realized engineering was the wrong metaphor.
- Middle management thinks planning software project is like building a bridge.
- But the right way to organize a team of devs isn't midwit agile ticket shit.
- The right way to organize any group of humans is to use the most ancient and battle-tested form of collective action.
<span style="text-align: center; display: block">Plan Like War.™</span>
- [War](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72qxqv34DqE), [bitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Wh66FXZJQ).
- [War](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhSy-6VqIww).
- So what's the war?
- According to the IMF, [40% of global employment](https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2024/01/14/ai-will-transform-the-global-economy-lets-make-sure-it-benefits-humanity#:~:text=Many%20studies%20have%20predicted%20the,employment%20is%20exposed%20to%20AI.) is exposed to automation by AI.
- In advanced economies, it's [closer to 60%](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/fandd/issues/2024/06/Economic-possibilities-for-my-grandchildren-Kristalina-Georgieva#:~:text=But%20it%20also%20comes%20with,may%20simply%20be%20rendered%20obsolete.).
- The jobs most exposed are those of the [educated and highly paid](https://time.com/6961559/ethan-mollick-ai-apocalypse-essay/#:~:text=Educated%20and%20highly%20paid%20workers).
- All of these jobs are now a cost that employers will compete to cut.
- In a business with a 20% margin, every $1 in cost-cutting is worth $5 in sales.
- The largest cost in running a company is employees.

![[060-but-the-highest-cost-is-labor.png|400]]

- With fewer employees comes [less](https://medium.com/@sushantvohra/your-boss-will-be-replaced-by-ai-before-you-do-91a8e7cca9fc) need [for](https://chatterhead.bearblog.dev/ai-will-replace-middle-management-not-hourly-workers/) middle [management](https://cmr.berkeley.edu/2021/01/middle-management-jobs/).
- It's now possible for many tech companies to eliminate the vast majority of both.
- Companies who execute this well can benefit from a negative feedback loop in input costs without a comparable loss in output.
- Doing without employees used to be out of the question, especially in tech, where the workforce is mostly advanced nerds with post-graduate STEM degrees, or ambitious autodidacts who are impressive enough without degrees.
- The world is different now.
- What a group of 10 or 20 could do in 2021, you can now accomplish with the best 1 or 2. 
- And the definition of "best" has suddenly tipped dramatically in favor of the generalists over the specialists, even in highly specialized fields.
- The AI apocalypse is here. But its effects are still mostly unrealized. The new world has arrived as potential energy waiting to become kinetic.
- As Ethan Mollick recently wrote in Time, the AI apocalypse we should worry about is not one of human extinction, but of the [many little apocalypses](https://time.com/6961559/ethan-mollick-ai-apocalypse-essay/#:~:text=It%20opens%20us%20up%20to%20many%20little%20apocalypses%2C%20as%20jobs%20and%20workplaces%20are%20disrupted%20one%2Dby%2Done%20in%20ways%20that%20change%20lives%20and%20livelihoods.) of every company that fails to rethink every level of its organization.
- Reid Hoffman predicts that the traditional [9-to-5 job will be extinct](https://www.businesstoday.in/latest/corporate/story/9-to-5-jobs-are-doomed-linkedin-co-founder-reid-hoffman-predicts-their-end-by-2034-438837-2024-07-26) by 2034.
- Such a dramatic prediction about the job market normally wouldn't be worth taking seriously. Coming from founder of LinkedIn, it may merit some thought.
- Our prediction implies his: the entrepreneurs who survive the coming decade will be the ones who understand how to operate at scale without full time employees.
- The organizations that will die in the coming decade are the large risk-averse corporations.
- The companies that retain their current org chart, and simply add an AI Strategy or AI Team in the hope of staying relevant will be the easiest prey for competitors who can execute the dramatic forms of cost-cutting this new technology enables.
- There has never been a time in history when it suddenly became so easy to undercut so many large corporations.
- The best way to do so is with a diffuse network of entrepreneurially minded individuals, outside the bounds of a single corporate umbrella.
- We need people who deeply understand [[#The Book of Tech|Tech]].
- We need people who are willing to take the leap and start a [[#The Book of Business|Business]].
- We need people who believe in each other and who aren't afraid of a good fight.
- "The opposite of war isn't peace, it's creation."
- And capitalism is creative destruction.
- Therefore capitalism is creation && war.
- Our field of was never "engineering."
- Cross out the e. It's silent anyway.
- Much better.
