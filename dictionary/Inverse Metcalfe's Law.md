## Regular Metcalfe's Law

The familiar Metcalfe's Law states that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of users. This means that as more people join a network, its value increases exponentially.

The term "value" in Metcalfe's Law is undefined. Further, it claims the value is a function of the number of nodes, rather than a more important property of a network: its density of edges.

We propose the following converse of the traditional Metcalfe's Law.

## Inverse Metcalfe's Law

The amount of hate that the users of a platform claim to possess for platform is inversely proportional to the density of edges of the social graphs that the platform brings into existence.

The maximum user-hate therefore occurs for apps such as Tinder and Instagram, while the minimum user-hate occurs for apps that build a complete graph of order N, where N is the number of edges.

No apps in the latter category are known to exist, even approximately.
