Like that.

That's a complete graph of order N, and it's the shape of social network that basically everyone lived their entire lives in throughout all of human history, until like, a few years ago.

This may be causing some problems at the moment.

For an unnecessary amount of extra mathematical details about this totally simple concept, see [Complete Graph - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_graph), but actually don't.
