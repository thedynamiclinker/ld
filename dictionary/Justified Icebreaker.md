Justified Icebreaker. (noun)

1. Any plausible reason to approach a stranger or initiate a conversation with someone who you don't already know. These justifications may be manufactured by the speaker, or provided by the external environment.

Example: Suppose two people in line at a coffee shop notice a pair of strangers engaged in a fist fight outside. In this case, the fight outside would constitute a Justified Icebreaker for the two people inside in line, giving each an excuse to open a conversation with the other. The more unusual or extreme the external event, the stronger is the justification.

## The Initiation Problem

Not a single business in the average modern city has managed to offer a solution to the following problem.

Problem: To strike up a conversation with a stranger, you need a plausible reason.

You can't just say "I'm lonely" or "You're cute."

(I mean sure, you can, but then the person tends to frown and throw garbage at you.)

In other words, to talk to strangers, you have to manufacture some excuse, ideally an excuse specific to the person in question. You can't say "I saw a guy one time who had nice shoes." You have to tell the person that _they_ have nice shoes, or something like that, even though most shoes are unremarkable, and thus useless as an excuse.

See before we've spoken to someone, we're by definition limited to commenting on only superficially observable features of them, their belongings, or our shared surroundings, in manufacturing an opening remark.

And there are apparently many quite social human beings, ones who wouldn't describe themselves as shy, for which the small-talky nature of remarks like "Nice glasses," "Cool hat," "My sister has those shoes," and other fabricated openers, feels sufficiently fake and distasteful that they choose instead not to try meeting people in public places.

Mostly, they just lack an important piece of information: whether they'd be bothering the person they're approaching.

And these days, most humans would prefer not to bother people.

So single women have no idea what to do.

And single men seem pretty lost too.

Same deal with people who are just looking for friends.

This is pretty fucking dumb.

We're going to solve this problem, because it's absurdly easy to do.

And for some reason solving it is something no one else is trying to do.
