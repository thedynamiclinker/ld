Justified Icebreaker. (noun)

1. Any plausible reason to approach a stranger or initiate a conversation with someone who you don't already know. These justifications may be manufactured by the speaker, or provided by the external environment.

Example: Suppose two people in line at a coffee shop notice a pair of strangers engaged in a fist fight outside. In this case, the fight outside would constitute a Justified Icebreaker for the two people inside in line, giving each an excuse to open a conversation with the other. The more unusual or extreme the external event, the stronger is the justification.

A justified icebreaker is the necessary ingredient in solving [[The Problem of What]].
