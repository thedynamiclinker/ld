Not a single business in the average modern city has managed to offer a solution to the following problem: To strike up a conversation with a stranger, you need a plausible reason.

That is, you have to manufacture some excuse, specific to the person in question. But before we've spoken to someone, we're by definition limited to superficially apparent attributes in manufacturing an opening remark.

And there are apparently many quite social human beings, ones who wouldn't describe themselves as shy, for which the small-talky nature of remarks like "Nice glasses," "Cool hat," "My sister has those shoes," and other fabricated openers, feels sufficiently fake and distasteful that they choose instead not to try meeting people in public places.

Mostly, they just lack an important piece of information: whether they'd be bothering the person they're approaching.

And these days, most humans would prefer not to bother people.

So single women have no idea what to do.

And single men seem pretty lost too.

Same deal with people who are just looking for friends.
