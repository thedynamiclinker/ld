## Four Fundamental Problems of Modern Social Life

In the modern world, if you want to meet someone new in a public setting, you'll have to overcome four specific barriers.

Each of these barriers is small, but omnipresent.

It is very rare to find any location that solves even one of these problems on purpose, as a direct consequence of its design.

Typically, individuals are left to resolve these problems for themselves.

We aim to create locations in which these problems are solved automatically, for everyone inside, allowing participants to receive benefits offered by no other location, without requiring them to understand the details of why it works.

The four problems we aim to solve are:

1. [[The Problem of Where]]
2. [[The Problem of When]]
3. [[The Problem of Who]]
4. [[The Problem of How]]
