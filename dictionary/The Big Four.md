## Four Fundamental Problems of Modern Social Life

In the modern world, if you want to meet someone new in a public setting, you'll have to overcome four specific barriers.

Each of these barriers is small, but they are omnipresent.

It is very rare to find any location that solves even one of these problems on purpose, as a direct consequence of its design.

Typically, each individual is left to resolve the problems by themself.

1. [[The Problem of Where]]
2. [[The Problem of When]]
3. [[The Problem of Who]]
4. [[The Problem of How]]
