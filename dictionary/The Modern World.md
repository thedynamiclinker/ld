Welcome to the modern world.

It's been 25 years since the internet boom of 2000 promised to revolutionize the way human beings connect.

Now, several decades on, there's never been a time in human history when it was so difficult to make real human connections. And there's never been a time when so many people were hungry for them.

All existing social apps, from dating apps to career apps to the large "social" networks, have made the world a dramatically less social and more lonely place.

All existing physical businesses where human beings congregate, from restaurants, to coffee shops, to neighborhood bars, have failed in precisely the same way, though this fact is less often recognized or discussed.

The modern world lacks even a loose approximation of the sort of [Third Places](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_place) our parents and grandparents had. Not because the spaces themselves do not exist, but because mobile technology has given each of us own portable virtual world into which we can escape, and from which we can draw dopamine. The presence of such technology in every public location has dramatically changed the social defaults of what might otherwise have been social spaces.

Both the virtual economy of bits and bytes, and the physical economy of brick and mortar have failed to address the crushing loneliness and social isolation of modern life.

It's not hard to understand why. Running a business is extremely hard, so it's nearly impossible for most owners to avoid becoming [this](https://youtu.be/MDPeLlMR2D4?si=EWMHTL-IxFGP5Ae8&t=148).

"So what?", some people say.

"Is this really a big deal?"

"We still have lots of ways to connect with people."

"After all, look at all my friends on social media."

We don't know you.

But we know you need more in life than another swipe app, or a slighty better burrito.

And we know you deserve a better answer to "Where to meet new people" than some non-sequitur like "take a pottery class" or "talk to people at the gym."
