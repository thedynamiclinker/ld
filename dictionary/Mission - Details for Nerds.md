This is going to move fast, and there's a lot of information behind the links. 

Lesser minds than yours will have trouble keeping up.

But new thoughts require new words if we want to properly describe them, so here's a first attempt in that direction.

## The low tech problem

Given the loneliness and social isolation that plague [[The Modern World]],

Our mission is to solve [[The Social Schelling Point Problem]],

And in doing so, to answer the commonly asked question of [[Where To Find People]].

We claim that this problem can be solved by a business with a built-in [[Justified Icebreaker]].

This is the missing ingredient that currently plagues all physical locations that claim to be a [[The Third Place|Third Place]].

Solving this problem requires opening a new category of business, like [[The Internet|this one]] and [[The Other Place|this one]].

We are currently working to open such locations.

## The high tech problem

The existence of these locations is a key pre-requisite that will enable us to attack a much more pernicious disease of modern life: [[The Implicit Attributes Problem]].

By using a combination of technology and the physical locations described above, we aim to perform [[Information Mining]] and storage of [[Implicit Attribute|Implicit Attributes]] in an opt-in manner, and in doing so, to create an embedding based search of a far richer set of information than can be represented in any online profile, and to do so without requiring that information to be published in natural language in any publicly visible way.

## WTF did I just read?
Sorry. That was a lot. So to say the same thing more simply: We're building physical locations where it's not awkward to meet new people, and tech that lets you find the kind of people you're looking for, using more than just pictures and some words in a profile.
