The Problem of Who. (noun).

The problem of determining which specific people in a given public space you would most enjoy talking to, interacting with, or getting to know.

You may enjoy these people because of a particular shared interest, or because of a more general compatability of mind.

Regardless of the reasons _why_ you might enjoy those people more than others, the fact that you _would_ is an [[Implicit Attribute]] of you, based on implicit attributes of them.

Since implicit attributes are by definition not visible from observation, something must be done before compatible individuals can find each other.

As such, this is an example of an [[Identification Problem]].

The Problem of Who is the problem of somehow helping you to find these people, and helping them to find you.
