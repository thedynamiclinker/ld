[^1]: We don't aim to solve this specific problem, nor is this necessarily a problem, but holy shit, something's going on in the Philippines, I mean just look at that graph dude, wow, I mean damn.

[^2]: K-1 is the visa you get when you legally marry an American citizen by the way, in case that wasn't clear. Again, that specific fact isn't a problem, but holy shit look at that graph again, I mean damn.
