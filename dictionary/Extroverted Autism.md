Extroverted Autism. (condition).

The social inability of certain extroverts to reason about the mental states of introverts.

Extroverted autism is characterized by a lack of social skills, sympathy, and theory of mind when interacting with introverts.

Individuals with extroverted autism often attempt to make smalltalk with introverts, failing to recognize that smalltalk is widely considered to be an anti-social behavior in introverted circles.

There is some evidence that the deficits in EA individuals are not limited to interactions with introverts.

Some scholars have argued that the condition is more appropriately defined as an extreme degree of competence in forming superficial social connections, and an extreme degree of incompetence in establishing any form of social connection beyond the superficial.

Those with extroverted autism often engage in superficially social behaviors, such as inviting social introverts to "social gatherings" in which there is:
- A total lack of intimacy or shared vulnerability.
- Little to no genuine human connection.
- A surplus of board games.

The desire to organize social gatherings is a common symptom of extroverted autism, but this desire in itself is not diagnostic, as it is equally common among individuals with actual social skills.

What is diagnostically significant is the quality -- not the quantity -- of the gatherings an individual organizes.

The so-called "social gatherings" organized by extroverted autistics turn out, upon further inspection, to be nothing more than rooms containing a large number of human bodies, most commonly the bodies of other extroverts who are equally lacking in social skills.

Individuals with extroverted autism suffer from an inability to distinguish between deeply meaningful human connection on the one hand, and mutually detestable chit-chat about sports, pets, and weather on the other.

Talk therapy with a highly social introvert has shown promise for individuals with extroverted autism, as social introverts are often able to raise the patient's awareness of their condition and its symptoms in a caring and understanding manner that the patient is less likely to reject.

However, treatment for this condition has proved difficult, as extroverts almost universally view themselves as "social" people, and do not like being told that their understanding of human connection is the social equivalent of [coconut headphones](https://nevsedoma.com.ua/en/598786-planes-made-of-straw-and-headphones-made-of-coconuts-how-the-americans-almost-killed-the-islanders-9-photos.html).
