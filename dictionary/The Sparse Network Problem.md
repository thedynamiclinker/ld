Problem:
- From the beginning of human history, until a few decades ago, all of human life occurred in social networks of maximal [[Betti Number]], also known as a [[Complete Graph of Order N]].
- Now, life occurs in social networks of minimal [[Betti Number]], also known as the [[Asshole Topology]].
- The human mind is not designed to work properly in the latter case, and is likely to produce phenomena such as social isolation, social anxiety, fragile social networks, increased maintenance time requirements for individual friendships, lack of friends, sexless men, sexless women, oversexed men, oversexed women, unrestrained hypergamy, freezing your eggs to focus on career, egirls, onlyfans, sexdolls, mass market plastic moulds of famous vaginas, AI girlfriends, AI friends, local bars full of televisions and pool tables but no talking because everyone's on their goddamn phones, tiktok, murder suicide, medical assistance in dying, and various other abominations of modern society that need not (or must not) be named in the interest of common decency.

In short, we claim that the absolute majority of modern social problems can be blamed in large part on the fact that the default background social network is shaped not like a [[Complete Graph of Order N]], but like an [[Asshole Topology|Asshole]].

See [[Asshole Topology]] for details on Assholes and how they contribute to the [Enshittification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification) of modern life.
