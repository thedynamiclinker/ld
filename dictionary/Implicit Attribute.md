An "implicit attribute" about you is any truth about you that isn't explicitly stated in any of your online profiles.

Nearly all truths about all people are implicit attributes.

Implicit attributes are no less true than the things you say on your LinkedIn, Tinder, or Facebook profile.

The difference is they're not searchable, so people looking for you using these dimensions cannot find you.
