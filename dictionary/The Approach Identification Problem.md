An [[Identification Problem]] faced by any individual in the modern world who would like to meet a new person or people in any public space.

The approach identification problem is the specific [[Identification Problem]] where the imperceptible attribute one is seeking is the willingness, or ideally desire, to be approached by strangers in general, or oneself in particular.

The existing methods of solving this problem are analogous to hacks or exploits in computer security. For example, assuming that open body language, or more than 8 brief glances in one's direction constitute willingness to be approached. While such signals are not valueless, they are hardly a solution to the identification problem of approach.

Fleeting physical locations are often created in an attempt to solve this problem, for example meetup groups designed for meeting new friends, singles mixers, speed dating, and other such events.

However, there appear to be no _stable physical locations_ designed to solve this problem, as a structural matter, by virtue of their design, for example by creating a business with a built-in [[Justified Icebreaker]].

## The Imperceptibility of Bothering

Lacking such locations, a solution to the approach identification problem is left to each individual.

Without guidance, many apparently social individuals simply give up.

In such cases, the fundamental human desire to meet new people in the physical world is sacrificed to the reasonable "desire not to bother them."

These days, most humans would prefer not to bother people.

So single women have no idea what to do.

And single men seem pretty lost too.

Same deal with people who are just looking for friends.

Pardon our language, but this is pretty fucking dumb.

We're going to solve this problem, because it's absurdly easy to do.

And for some reason solving it is something no one else is trying to do.
