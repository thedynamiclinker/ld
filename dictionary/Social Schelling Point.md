Social Schelling Point. (noun)

Any person X in a Social Schelling Point can be confident that any other individual Y in the same location is open to meeting new people, because all individuals present in that location entered it with full knowledge of that location's purpose. Any such person X in a Social Schelling Point can be confident, even before talking to any other person Y, that Y will not be bothered or annoyed if X approaches and initiates a conversation. This knowledge does not require X and Y to communicate, it is implied by their shared presence in the location. In other words, they that's why they're both there.
