Social Schelling Point. (noun)

A physical location specifically optimized for meeting new people.

A __Weak Social Schelling Point__ is any location that publicly declares itself to be a solution to [[The Problem of Where]]. In other words, a Weak Social Schelling point is one that publicly self identifies as being designed for meeting new people, whether or not it actually achieves that goal in any measurable way.

A __Strong Social Schelling Point__ is any location that additionally solves [[The Problem of When]] by explicitly prohibiting participation of, or implicitly disincentivising participation by, individuals who are not currently open to meeting new people at that moment.

A Strong Social Schelling Point solves the problem of _where_ to meet new people, and guarantees or strongly suggests that everyone inside is currently open to doing so _when_ they are in that location.

Any person X in a Strong Social Schelling Point can be confident that any other individual Y in the same location is open to meeting new people, because all individuals present in that location entered it with full knowledge of that location's purpose.

Any such person X in a Social Schelling Point can be confident, even before talking to any other person Y, that Y will not be bothered or annoyed if X approaches and initiates a conversation.

This knowledge does not require X and Y to communicate, it is implied by their shared presence in the location. In other words, they that's why they're both there.

This concept is a specific case of the concept of a [Schelling Point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_point_(game_theory)) in game theory.

However, no Strong Social Schelling Points appear to exist, at present.

The lack of such locations will be referred to as [[The Social Schelling Point Problem]].
