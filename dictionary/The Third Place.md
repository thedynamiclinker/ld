The modern world can be a pretty lonely place.

We believe this is not an inevitable result of human psychology, or smartphones, or modern society overall.

We believe the loneliness of modern life is a direct consequence of the nonexistence of a certain type of place 一 specifically a certain type of business 一 often called a Third Place.

It is those businesses that we aim to create.

We believe that every other business currently in existence is pathetically failing to address this problem, including the ones that claim to be "[reclaiming the third place](https://stories.starbucks.com/emea/stories/2024/reclaiming-third-places-our-bold-vision-for-community-stores/)."

We intend to do things differently.

We're currently working on opening several physical locations.

That was a lot of marketing buzzwords. Let's rephrase that.

Every location we open aims to solve a simple problem:

- Starting from a conventional business model, like a coffee shop, restaurant, or bar.
- Add some simple rule or constraint that applies inside the business, with the goal of removing the awkwardness of interacting with strangers.

The resulting businesses must be both:

1. Profitable enough to sustain and grow, and
2. Not simply lead to a room full of individuals on their laptops, phones, or in small groups of people that already knew each other when they arrived together.

That is, it must be more comfortable, in each business, to interact with strangers than it is to avoid doing so, for the largest possible range of individual personality types. And this feature must be present at all times of day, not only during the afternoons and evenings when it's the perfect time for a few drinks.

After all, if there's one thing that people of all ages agree on these days, it's that people don't seem to talk to each other like they used to. Let's fix that.
