A network of N people, where everyone knows everyone else.

Draw N dots.

Each dot is a person.

Then draw an edge between all possible pairs of those dots.

Each edge represents the fact that those two people know each other.

Exactly.

Like that.

That's a complete graph of order N, and it's the shape of social network that basically everyone lived their entire lives in throughout all of human history, until like, a few years ago.

This may be causing some problems at the moment.

For an unnecessary amount of extra mathematical details about this totally simple concept, see [Complete Graph - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_graph), but actually don't.

For the opposite of a complete graph, see the [[Asshole Topology]].
