Problem: Most Attributes of People are [[Implicit Attribute|Implicit Attributes]], and are therefore not searchable either in any public meeting space or on any current online platform.

## People you can't find

Consider the problem of social search based on arbitrary attributes.

For example, consider the problems of:

1. A documentary film-maker making a film about addiction, who wants to find everyone in a city who has ever tried heroin, whether currently addicted, currently in rehab, or whether they recovered from the addiction years ago.
2. A 24yo girl in [[The Philippines Problem|the Philippines]] who wants to meet single American men who would be potentially open to dating and eventually marrying someone overseas. She's tried OkCupid, but her American matches all unmatched her for being overseas. There are constant complaints about this on r/okcupid. She also briefly tried an IMBRA regulated marriage brokerage agency, but all the men were old and unattractive. They were old and unattractive because that set of men wasn't just sampled from the set of all single American men who were potentially willing to marry someone overseas, but rather was sampled from the set of men _specifically looking_ to do so, and looking for this so intensely that they took the effort to download an app designed for that. That is a wildly unrepresentative subset of all the men who would be down to fall in love with and eventually marry a person overseas, if they met the right one.
3. The large number of so-called "Unicorn hunters." Namely, a straight guy, and a straight or bisexual girl who are looking for a long-term committed throuple (three person relationship) with a single female. There are so many of these couples that they are often banned or muted on apps designed for polyamory, with some such apps having a specific setting for "Do not show Unicorn hunters." Such couples are called Unicorn Hunters because they're often thought to be looking for a type of female that is extremely rare or perhaps doesn't exist. This isn't true. But most of the so-called "Unicorns" that they're looking for do not identify as polyamorous, and therefore never download an app for poly people. Further, most such people have less luck on conventional apps like okcupid, because most of the non-poly girls who would be happy to date a couple have reflexively selected "Only show single people" as the default, because why wouldn't they? It's an inevitable default behavior on any app designed _specifically_ for dating. The same female would never think to filter "Only show single people" on LinkedIn, both because (a) LinkedIn doesn't have that filter, and (b) people don't use LinkedIn for dating. As a result, it's actually much easier for either member of our hypothetical poly couple to meet their hypothetical Unicorn on LinkedIn than on a datin app, because they're not filtered out on LinkedIn in the same way they are on apps designed for dating in general, or poly dating in particular. In other words, the _worst_ apps for certain classes of dating behavior are, in fact, dating apps. And those classes of behavior are sufficiently frequent to have a name and be banned from apps ostensibly designed for them.
4. Any other attribute of people that someone might be interested in, for any reason, whether dating, career, friendship, finding investors, meeting a co-founder, etc., but which is difficult or impossible to find because (a) no domain-specific app for that search problem exists, or (b) even when such a domain-specific app exists, the people one aims to find would never download that app.

In short:
- Formerly addicted heroin users
- American men willing to date a girl overseas, or
- Single girls open to dating couples
rarely if ever download the same apps as the people who are looking for them.

After all, why would they?

This is perhaps the most easily solvable fundamental problem of human existence ever to go unaddressed for so long. It's absolutely pathetic, both from a business perspective and a human one.

We can do better without breaking a sweat.

## Apps know almost nothing about you

This is the Implicit Attributes Problem.

Nearly 100% of the attributes a person has will NOT be stated explicitly in that person's profile on any app.

Even the "free" apps whose entire business model is collecting as much data about you and then selling it STILL know almost nothing relevant about you that other users might want to know.

This is a fundamental problem with the design of:
- Every dating app (e.g., Tinder, OkCupid, Bumble, Hinge)
- Every career app (e.g., LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor, Monster)

As a result, the apps designed to help users "find the right people" for dating, friendship, employment, or any other reason all fail to index well over 99% of relevant information, _even about the people who already use their platform._

## Gathering more data is seen as creepy

Worse still, any attempt that existing apps make to gather more data or monetize it more is bad publicity. Doing so makes the app appear more creepy or less trustworthy in the eyes of their users.

Any app that managed to incentivise users to voluntarily gather and store as many details about one another as possible, and managed to do so without appearing untrustworthy or creepy in the eyes of its users would have unlocked a unique dataset not possessed by any existing app.

## Solution

This problem can likely be solved by [[Information Mining]], but it is difficult to incentivise users to engage in Information Mining in the quantities required to solve this problem.
