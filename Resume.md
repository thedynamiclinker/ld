Welcome to LD.

We're a new kind of company, for a new kind of world.

TODO: Write a SUPER SANE thing here, about AI, Reid Hoffman, the future of work in an AI dominated world, and how we believe that means a different future for a lot of things about companies in general, e.g., there will be more of them, more entrepreneurs and fewer employees, and we believe that means a more human future involves less shallow professionalism and more a human world where the boundary between individuals and brands begins to blur, and can do so without becoming a corporate dystopia, because it's in everyone's interest to find the people they like who like them, and then work together.

Include thing from archaeology about how employees at present have no ability to determine who they work with day to day, without essentially hacking the current system by trying to hire all your best friends whenever you switch jobs. That's dumb.

Tell the story of W || K. The story of how Ramya and I used to work at a company together. We found we really enjoyed working together. She was good at all the things I sucked at and vice-versa, and we both learned a ton every day we worked together. When the time came that W decided to leave that job, we realized we had a decision to make. 

Suppose you have a close friend at work. You enjoy working with them more than the job itself. This leads to a situation where we stay at jobs for the people, not for the vision or the work.
